## Overview

The purpose of this project is to take in typed text from a person and use machine learning algorithms to precict the personality type of that person. The personality type predictions are based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test as the target variable. The features or predictor variables are comments and posts from users on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [PersonalityCafe](https://www.personalitycafe.com/). These posts and comments come from users who have explicitley labeled their MBTI personality on their profile. 

The Myers-Briggs test is a very popular test that ask users approximately 90 questions about their behavior and assigns the user a type of personality based on this assessment. This test takes around 20-30 for someone to complete. 

There are 16 different personality types using a combination of 8 overall traits. See below:

    Introversion (I) **vs** Extroversion (E)
    Intuition (N) **vs** Sensing (S)
    Thinking (T) **vs** Feeling (F)
    Judging (J) **vs** Perceiving (P)
